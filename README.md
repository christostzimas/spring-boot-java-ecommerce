# E-Commerce Platform Backend - Java Implementation

This project involves the development of the back-end application for an e-commerce platform using Spring Boot. The application manages products, customers, orders, and reviews, providing essential features for a modern e-commerce platform, such as product listings, user management, order processing, and customer feedback.

The project was implemented as part of an educational assignment and marked my first experience with Spring Boot. One notable aspect of the project was the requirement for the use of inheritance.

## Features
